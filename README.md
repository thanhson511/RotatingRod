# RotatingRod
Volume and surrounding area of the 3D shape get by rotating rod

Consider a rod of length l cm, denoted by PQ. Two rods of equal length r cm, denoted by PS and QR, are welded perpendicularly to PQ at its ends P and Q, respectively. Rods PS and QR are also perpendicular to each other. A thin rod connects points R and S. If the entire apparatus is rotated 360 degrees about the axis RS,  what are the volume and the surrounding area of the 3D shape enclosed by the curved surface PQRS.
